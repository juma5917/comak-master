        <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>Training in the safe way for workers to do their jobs well is an investment that will pay
            back over and over again in fewer injuries and illnesses, better morale, lower insurance
            premiums and more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Comak trainings utilize a combination of lecture-style presentations, interactive open discussions, practical demonstrations 
            including role plays, engaging video and audio-visual materials, as well as collaborative group exercises. These diverse approaches 
            collectively enhance the overall learning experience for all participants.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon the successful conclusion of the training, all course participants will receive certificates that have been officially recognized 
            and approved by the Directorate of Occupational Health and Safety Services(DOSHS).
